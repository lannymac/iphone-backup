This program will read in the sql database made by iTunes during an iPhone backup. The sms messages will be obtained and with the sms class, slight analysis can be performed.

As of right now, I made this program for me and my partner so that we can track how many text messages we sent to each other. I haven't yet made the program general. Will fix in the future.

Use smssql.py to retrieve the database files and sms.py and sms class to perform statistics.

TO DO:
-Add support for iMessages
-Make for general public and choose who the statistics are performed on

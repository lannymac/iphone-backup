This program will read in the sql database made by iTunes during an iPhone backup. The sms messages will be obtained and with the sms class, slight analysis can be performed.

Use smssql.py to retrieve the database files and sms.py and sms class to perform statistics.

TO DO:
-Fix sms.fft to work properly. I really cannot figure it out to work with my data.
